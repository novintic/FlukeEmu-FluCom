# FluCom2
The FluCom2 Interface is a stack-on board (HAT) for a Raspberry Pi 3 or higher. Itâ€™s purpose is to interface with Pods for the Fluke 9000 series Microsystem Troubleshooter which is still used today to diagnose and repair vintage computer equipment such as arcade game pcbs.

It is designed to be used in conjunction with the FlukeEmu software.

The idea behind the project is to use readily available parts to provide an as-simple-as-possible (cheap) way to replace a Fluke 9010a Mainframe.

The board and its design files are made available under the CERN Open Hardware License: https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2
