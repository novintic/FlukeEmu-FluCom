The tried and tested version is TSSOP. At the time of designing the board the TSX0104 level shifters were only available in this package.

As the SOIC package became available again, a version of the board has been adapted (as these are much easier to solder). 
However, this version has not been built or tested by me yet. It passes DRC, that's all I can say at the moment. Build at your own risk.

Added version 3 of the interface board ('FluCom3'). This version will be needed to add the probe board once it is released. The only difference is the new pin header for this purpose. So far, there is only a SOIC version.

The older boards ('FluCom2') will continue to work fine (although without probe option) as there were no changes made to the interface part of the system.
