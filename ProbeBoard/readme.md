# Probe add-on- board for FluCom Raspberry Pi HAT

This add-on board for the FluCom Raspberry Pi HAT provides full probe functionality for the FlukeEmu/FluCom hardware/software Emulation of the Fluke 9010A Micro-System Troubleshooter.

Basically this makes the Fluke 9010A emulation feature- complete.

As much of the original circuitry as possible was implemented using a Raspberry PICO microcontroller. 

However, due to the original design of the probe, a significant amount of analog circuitry had to be reproduced in order to keep the system working with legacy probes.

The board and its design files are made available under the CERN Open Hardware License: https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2
