Check and correct IC orientation!

IMPORTANT: Fuse F1 is not included in BOM/Placement file. Either add it manually or simply jumper it (PTC fuses won't offer the same protection as conventional 'fast-blow' fuses anyway). Probe should be protected up to +/- 30V, so just keep it away from higher voltages.
